		<p>My name is Amy Mulvihill. I am a writer and editor living in Baltimore.</p>
		<p><a href="betamore.org/academy">I am trying to learn html and other basic coding languages in order to make myself more employable.</a></p>
		<p>In my spare time, I enjoy napping, eating, going for walks, and annoying my cat.</p>
